gfl_web
=======

Uses Python's Flask module to create a web-based interface for GFL-FUDGE annotation. 

By Michael Mordowanec, Nathan Schneider

Getting Started
===============

The code in this repository requires Python 2.7 and Flask 0.10.1. It also depends on the gfl_syntax project repository, which in turn uses parsimonious and graphviz to parse annotaions and create a .png representation.

To get started, simply cd to the repository and run:
> python FlaskGFL.py

This will create a server on you local machine, which will allow you to annotate in your browser. Installing on an actual server requires some expertise.

After running the utility, .preproc files can be added to the preproc directory in your app's data directory. .preproc is the format used by the gfl_syntax tools whose repository has scripts to help create it. Files added here will automatically be converted to JSON and appear as a list of batches on the admin screen.
